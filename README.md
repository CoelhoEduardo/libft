# LIBFT PROJECT

![Libft badge](https://github.com/CoelhoEduardo/libft/assets/76714413/4cc5ccdf-8fa2-48d8-8749-6f83a4fc53f9)

## Description:

My first project as a 42SP network student, to learn more about libc and create my own implementation.
I learned about pointers, memory allocation, structs and linked lists.

### This project is separated into three parts: 

#### Part I 
All the functions implemented exist in the real libc, and the focus is to work with strings and memory manipulation.

#### Part II
Here I develop some functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.

### Bonus (optional)

In the Bonus section, I develop some functions that work with lists.

### How to use:

- You just need to have a project in C;

- Implement a rule in your makefile project that executes the libft together;

- And include the libft.h in your header file;
